# --- Day 7: Handy Haversacks ---

You land at the regional airport in time for your next flight. In fact, it looks like you'll even have time to grab some food: all flights are currently delayed due to issues **in luggage processing**.

Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!

For example, consider the following rules:

	light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
	dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
	bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
	muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
	shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
	dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
	vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
	faded blue bags contain no other bags.
	dotted black bags contain no other bags.
